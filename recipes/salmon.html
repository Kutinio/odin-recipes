<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Have a perfectly cooked salmon fillet, complete with crisp skin, ready in under 10 minutes. Serve with a side of
    buttery, seasonal green veg for a filling supper
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 x 150g salmon fillets (about 4cm thick), skin on</li>
    <li>½ tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>20g unsalted butter</li>
    <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>

</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Generously season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Put the oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan over
        a medium heat, swirling around the pan until melted and foaming, then turn up the heat. Once the butter starts
        bubbling, add the salmon fillets to the pan, skin-side-down, and fry for 3 minutes until crisp. Flip the fillets
        over, lower the heat and cook for 2 minutes more, then drizzle with the lemon juice. Transfer the salmon to a plate
        and baste with any of the buttery juices left in the pan.
